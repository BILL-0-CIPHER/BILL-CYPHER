## **Advanced File Management and Log Processing Tool**

This tool is a Python-based, multi-purpose utility designed for managing and processing text files, logs, and compressed archives. It is tailored to handle large datasets, extract sensitive information, and organize data efficiently. The tool provides a command-line interface for users to navigate through its features seamlessly.

### **Key Features**

#### **1. Text File Management (.txt)**
- **Smart Search:** Quickly search for specific keywords in text files and save the results in organized reports.
- **Automatic Deletion:** Remove text files based on specific names or contents.
- **Extract Sensitive Data:** Parse text files to extract credentials like `username:password` or `url:username:password` and save them in structured formats.

#### **2. Compressed Archive Management (.zip, .rar)**
- **Targeted Extraction:** Extract specific files or folders from archives using filters (e.g., country name).
- **Format Support:** Handles `.zip` and `.rar` formats.
- **Organized Output:** Automatically stores extracted content in predefined directories for easy access.

#### **3. Folder Management**
- **Folder Deletion:** Remove folders based on specific keywords.
- **Log Counting by Region:** Count and display the number of logs based on region codes (e.g., `US`, `FR`).

#### **4. Database Creation**
- **Log Aggregation:** Extract and consolidate data into databases in formats like `username:password` or `url:username:password`.
- **Remove Duplicates:** Identify and filter out duplicate data, ensuring only unique entries are saved.
- **Save Results:** Save both unique and non-unique data in separate output files.

#### **5. User-Friendly Interface**
- **Simple Menu:** Navigate through the tool using a command-line menu with ASCII art headers for enhanced user experience.
- **Detailed Reports:** Generate reports after each operation, including processing time and output summaries.
